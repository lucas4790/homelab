# 🚀 Homelab Project Status

## ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### 🏗️ **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Essential Apps**

#### Infrastructure ✅
- **Minikube Environment**: Set up with 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 30GB disk
- **ArgoCD**: Deployed and running (GitOps controller)
- **cert-manager**: Deployed with cluster issuers (self-signed, Let's Encrypt staging/prod)
- **Namespaces**: All required namespaces created
- **Helm Repositories**: Added and configured

#### Applications ✅
- **MinIO**: Object storage (S3-compatible) - Ready to deploy
- **Nextcloud**: File sync & collaboration platform - Ready to deploy
- **Homepage**: Service dashboard - Ready to deploy

#### Directory Restructure ✅
**MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: Completely reorganized the project structure from a confusing, redundant mess to a clean, logical organization:

**Before**: 100+ directories with massive duplication (each app in 5+ places)
**After**: 25 purposeful directories with single source of truth

#### Scripts & Automation ✅
- **setup-minikube.sh**: Automated minikube setup with all dependencies
- **deploy-phase1.sh**: Complete Phase 1 deployment automation
- **test-services.sh**: Service health checking
- **update-hosts.sh**: Automatic /etc/hosts management

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS**

### What's Working ✅
- Minikube cluster running
- ArgoCD deployed and operational (admin password: `iQViwBR6U8wY-Fnh`)
- cert-manager with cluster issuers
- All namespaces created
- Helm charts properly structured
- Directory structure completely reorganized
- Deployment scripts working

### What's Pending ⏳
- **Git Push**: Need to push changes to GitHub for ArgoCD to sync applications
- **Minikube Tunnel**: Need stable tunnel for service access
- **Service Testing**: Full end-to-end service validation

## 🔄 **NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS**

1. **Push to GitHub** 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: restructure project and implement Phase 1"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify ArgoCD Sync**
   ```bash
   kubectl get applications -n argocd
   # Should show "Synced" status after git push
   ```

3. **Access Services**
   ```bash
   # In separate terminal:
   minikube tunnel
   
   # Then access:
   # http://argocd.homelab.local
   # http://minio-console.homelab.local  
   # http://nextcloud.homelab.local
   # http://homepage.homelab.local
   ```

## 🚀 **FUTURE PHASES (Ready to Implement)**

### Phase 2: Authentication & Security
- Authentic/Authelia SSO
- Vault secrets management
- Enhanced RBAC

### Phase 3: Media Services
- Jellyfin media server
- Immich photo management
- Arr stack (Sonarr, Radarr)

### Phase 4: Productivity
